details that you wouldn’t be able to see otherwise and a whole new world opens up. I would walk around a take close up pictures of
anything I could find so I could find out what they looked like zoomed in. This is how my passion for photography started to grow
and continues to grow as I find new angles to look at the world."</p><hr/> <p>Aside from taking awesome photos, Eric is the loving father of a cute little two-year old girl, and is expecting another child very soon. He's been married to his supportive and energetic wife for several years now. Eric works as a Systems Administrator for Brigham Young University and knows anything and everything there is to know about computer and network systems!
  <hr/><p>Eric loves to travel to new places and explore the world, you'll notice many of his sample shots are from different countries around the world!</p>
